/**
 * The Polymorph iOS SDK mediates third party Ad Networks using custom events.
 *
 * `PMBannerCustomEvent` is a base class for custom events that support banners. By implementing
 * subclasses of `PMBannerCustomEvent` you can enable the Polymorph SDK to natively support a wide
 * variety of third-party ad networks.
 *
 * At runtime, the Polymorph SDK will find and instantiate an `PMBannerCustomEvent` subclass as needed and
 * invoke its `-requestAdWithSize:customEventInfo:` method.

 * this message to your custom event class. Your implementation of this method can either load a
 * banner ad from a third-party ad network, or execute any application code. It must also notify the
 * `PMBannerCustomEventDelegate` of certain lifecycle events.
 *
 * @param size The current size of the parent `PMBannerView`.  You should use this information to create
