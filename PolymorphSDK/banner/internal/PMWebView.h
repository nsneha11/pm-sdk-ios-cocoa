/***
 * PMWebView
 * This class is a wrapper class for WKWebView and UIWebView. Internally, it utilizes WKWebView when possible, and
 * falls back on UIWebView only when WKWebView isn't available (i.e., in iOS 7). PMWebView's interface is meant to
 * imitate UIWebView, and, in many cases, PMWebView can act as a drop-in replacement for UIWebView. PMWebView also
 * blocks all JavaScript text boxes from appearing.
 *
 * While `stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:` does exist for UIWebView compatibility reasons, it's highly
 * recommended that the caller uses `evaluateJavaScript:completionHandler:` whenever code can be reworked
 * to make use of completion blocks to keep the advantages of asynchronicity. It solely fires off the javascript
 * execution within WKWebView and does not wait or return.
 *
 * PMWebView currently does not support a few other features of UIWebView -- such as pagination -- as WKWebView also
 * does not contain support.
